# **Seeing is Believing**: Enhancing Basketball Shot-Prediction With Visual Context

Welcome to the official repository for our paper [Seeing is Believing](www.google.com). We implement a simple and universal framework for evaluating player shot-quality using in-context visual and statistical features. This codebase is intended to be realtively simple to set up. However, feel free to open a pull request in the likely case you find a bug or think of an improvement.
